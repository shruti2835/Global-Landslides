# Global-Landslides
In this project, I have analysed the landslides that have occurred globally. For this project, I have used the data that is available on the Nasa Open Source data portal. I have explored the triggers of landslides, countries with most landslides, fatality count by countries, fatality count based on landslide triggers in different countries, fatality count based on landslide triggers over the years (1988 to 2017), fatality count by landslide size, and fatality count by landslide size in different countries. 
The results of the analysis shows that, 
1) Main cause of landslides is Rainfall.
2) USA, followed by India and China have had more significant landslides over the years in the world.
3) India followed by China, and Afghanistan have had high fatality count.  
4) In most of the countries fatalities are caused due to rainfall-triggered landslides.
5) Rainfall triggered landslides have caused the most number of deaths over the years 1988 to 2017. Another cause following rainfall is tropical cyclone that has resulted in more deaths.
6) Very Large sized landslide resulted in more number of fatalities. Interesting Observation is that medium sized landslides caused more fatalities than large sized landslides. 
7) Countries such as India, China, and Afghanistan have very large sized landslides therefore the fatality count is highest in these countries. There are also countries such as Brazil, Taiwan, and Uganda also have very large sized landslides but fatality count is lower. 
8) Most of the European countries experience small to medium sized landslides. 
9) Most of the countries in Africa, North American, and South American continents experience small to large sized landslides.
